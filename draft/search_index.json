The minimal platform\nis binary component oriented, but designed to enable a highly optimized form for\nembedded boot loaders.\n"},"1_introduction/11_audience__document_scope.html":{"url":"1_introduction/11_audience__document_scope.html","title":"1.1 Audience / Document scope","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The Minimum Platform Architecture is intended to\nintroduce interfaces and structure so that platforms are consistent and thus\napproachable by engineers from across the ecosystem. The minimal platform\nspecifically refers to a platform layer within a multi-layer solution; its\nscope and therefore this specification defines this layer and its dependencies.\nThe minimal platform is a single code package used as-is from open source\nsimilar to MDE Module package usage. By using this platform as a base, the\nfundamental boot flow is consistent, well-documented, and visible across the\nUEFI community.\nThis approach does not rule out innovation and customization. The platform\ncalls two primary sets of external APIs throughout the boot, for board and\nchipset initialization. These APIs are considered dependencies, and therefore\nare defined in this specification. The implementation of these APIs is expected\nto vary based on unique board and chipset requirements. Furthermore, the\nminimal platform can be arbitrarily extended through a simple and modular\nadvanced feature design.\nThe Minimum Platform Architecture enables scalability from pre-silicon\nvalidation activities, to final product shipment, to derivative product use.\nThe Minimum Platform Architecture should enable engineering activities from all\nsegments: from high-touch Intel supported OEMs to individual makers with\nprevious UEFI experience but no direct support from Intel.\n"},"1_introduction/12_document_flow.html":{"url":"1_introduction/12_document_flow.html","title":"1.2 Document Flow","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

As such, the key elements of architecture and design\n(flows, interfaces, etc) are organized into a staged architecture, where each\nstage will have requirements and functionality that lead to specific uses.\nStages build upon prior stages with extensibility to meet silicon, platform,\nor board requirements.\nEarly in a development cycle, engineering is focused on creating the platform\nand acquiring basic functionality. This can be pursued within simulation and\nemulation environments, or on real hardware. This often includes creating a\nnew set of silicon and platform source code that handles the basic differences\nbetween the new target and prior solutions. Often this entails reuse of the\nprior generation silicon support and existing feature sets.\nLater development engineering effort is focused on enabling the full range\nof functionality, supporting all deltas in the new platform - typically in\nthe form of reference designs and lead products. Next, platform development\nis focused on scaling.  This involves customer enabling and aligning products\nfor time-to-market and silicon roadmaps. Finally, there is sustaining,\nmaintenance, and derivatives activity. These are characterized by smaller\nchanges to existing production-worthy solutions, repurposing them\nopportunistically.\n\nFigure 1 Minimum Platform Architecture Overview\nFigure 1 shows the basic Minimum Platform Architecture. The enabling steps\nfor a Minimum Platform solution should occur in the following order to add\ncomplexity over time, and only where it is necessary. This progression from\nminimum required to more full-featured permeates the design of the boot flow,\nmodules implemented, and collection of components into firmware volumes.\n\nDevelop a board solution around the minimum platform. This involves\nimplementing the essential board information and initialization defined in\nthe Minimum Platform board API.\nAdd silicon initialization support. For many silicon vendors this\nwill be accomplished through the use of binary blobs with well-defined\ninterfaces. In any case, the silicon initialization invocation is performed\nfrom the board code.\nAdd advanced features, which are typically implemented in the form of\nsource code designed to be generically plugged into a large number of diverse\nsystem types.\nAdd product-specific features that are required for product initialization.\nThis support is not part of essential board organization or maintained as a\ngeneric advanced feature. It is enabled in the advanced feature stage.\n\n\nFigure 2 Minimum Platform Architecture High Level Sequence\nFigure 2 shows the same basic idea can be represented as a Venn diagram with\nthree fundamental steps.\nThis architecture is reflected in these areas:\n\nSource code in modules, packages, and resulting binary components\nExecution in control, data, error, and debug flows\nFunctionality as solutions evolve from initial to complete\nScaling from silicon development to products\n\n"},"2_architecture/21_staged_architecture.html":{"url":"2_architecture/21_staged_architecture.html","title":"2.1 Staged Architecture","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The\nstages capture what is minimally required to support the strategic objectives\nof transparency and quality as well as the more tactical objectives of\nstructure, consistency, cohesion, coupling, and compatibility. Note that the\nstages represent enabling steps, not necessarily the order of execution. For\nexample, ACPI initialization necessary in Stage IV may be performed before\nStage III would be considered complete. Further, the stages may not necessarily\nbe strictly additive once enabling is complete. For example, the UEFI shell may\nnot be required in the production firmware image based on product requirements,\nbut it must have been enabled and therefore capable of being loaded in the\nfinal firmware if chosen by a firmware engineer supporting the firmware in the\nfinal production image.\n"},"2_architecture/22_modularity.html":{"url":"2_architecture/22_modularity.html","title":"2.2 Modularity","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Dynamic linking in the form of UEFI PI\nArchitecture components (PEIM and drivers) as well as large grain Firmware\nVolume containers are also used extensively in order to increase leverage,\nscalability, and large grain FV container updates.\nAn important concept is that the minimum platform is defined with a mix of\nsolutions for modularity, but that said modularity will be flexible. It is\nintended that products will be able to scale from fully statically-linked\nembedded solutions to fully dynamically-linked leveraged validation solutions\nas they reach the end of Stage VII optimization activities.

Sometimes governed by industry standards, sometimes\nproprietary. Silicon or hardware code is usually not intended to have\nmultiple implementations for the same hardware.\nProducer(s): Silicon vendor\n\n\n\n\nPlatform defines the actions needed to enable a specific platform's\ncapabilities. In this architecture, capabilities are divided into mandatory\nand advanced features. Mandatory features are enabled in stages prior to\nStage VI. Advanced features are enabled in Stage VI and later.\nMinimum Platform Producer(s): TianoCore.org\nAdvance Feature Producer(s): TianoCore.org, OEM, BIOS vendor\n\n\n\n\nBoard packages contains board specific code for one or more motherboards.\nProducer(s): Device manufacturer, BIOS vendor, Board user\n\n\n\nThe architecture is designed to support a maintainer ownership model. For\nexample, board developers should not directly modify (fork) the platform,\nsilicon, or common code. More details on conventional usage of the package\nclassifications can be found in supplemental literature from UEFI Forum,\nTianoCore.org, and others.\nFor the purposes of this document, the board package is considered an\nintegration point of the firmware image in addition to providing board-specific\nfunctionality. The silicon package provides supported silicon initialization\nsupport for one or more silicon products. The minimum platform package\nrepresents common elements of this architecture that may depend upon board and\nsilicon interfaces. In order to meet the security objectives of this\nspecification, the minimum platform package must not depend upon deprecated EDK\nII packages.

These control\nflows are common to all platforms. Therefore, a single implementation is\nintended to serve all platforms. This implementation is maintained in the\nMinPlatformPkg on TianoCore.org. Throughout the standardized boot flow,\nimplementation-specific details are required including board resource\ninformation for devices, buses, GPIO settings, etc. In addition, logic is\nnecessary to integrate the silicon solution. For IntelÂ® FSP, this involves\ninvoking the appropriate FSP API with the proper parameters at the proper time\nin the boot flow. Such details are implemented in the board package behind the\nboard API defined in this specification. This results in flexibility at the\nboard layer for a custom software design that allows substitution of details\nlike silicon initialization flow while maintaining a common control flow with\nother platforms. The board package is also typically responsible for other\nimplementation-specific integration such as providing a custom build\nenvironment that prepares a firmware image processed by the tools required to\nproduce an image compatible for a given board.\n"},"3_stage_1_minimum_debug/":{"url":"3_stage_1_minimum_debug/","title":"3 Stage I: Minimal Debug","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

As Stage I is\ninherently foundational to product execution it may include more content and\ncomplexity than the functionality strictly required for debug output.\n3.1.1 Major Execution Activities\n\nEstablish temporary memory.\nPerform pre-memory board-specific initialization.\nBoard detection\nGPIOs\nSerial Port initialization (Example: SIO, HSUART)\n\nIt is not necessary for the developer to fully configure GPIO at this time. The\nonly required board configuration is that necessary to reach system debug\nactivities.\n3.1.2 Main Control Flow\nStage I is contained within SEC and PEI phases. Code must not be compressed and\ncontent must be capable of being mapped to memory by hardware or other firmware.\nThe high level control flow is described in the diagram below.\n\nFigure 4 Stage I Main Control Flow\nThese activities do not map 1:1 to the required functions. Some of this flow is\nalready well defined by UEFI or EDK II specifications.

EDK II modules are typically written to be generic and\nreusable. As such, much of the build file content is the same for all\nplatforms. The platform architecture provides further structure and consistency\nby defining dedicated build files that are exposed to all consumers of the\nplatform package. The modular separation of the build files is based on the\nUEFI PI Architecture phases, the platform architecture stages, and optional\nfeatures. The board package is ultimately able to leverage as much of this\ncontent as applicable for a given system. The build is coordinated by the board\npackage which should include standard build files from the minimum platform\npackage or other dependent packages such as a silicon package.\n\n\n\nName\nConsumer\nStandalone Buildable\nFV Produced\nComments\n\n\n\n\nMinPlatformPkg\\Include\\CoreCommonLib.dsc\nBoard\nNo\nNone\nStage I-V common libraries\n\n\nMinPlatformPkg\\Include\\CorePeiInclude.dsc\nBoard\nNo\nNone\nCombination of Stage I-Vthat will be processed by compilation building\n\n\nMinPlatformPkg\\Include\\CorePeiLib.dsc\nBoard\nNo\nNone\nCombination of Stage I-Vthat will be processed by compilation building\n\n\nBoardPkg\\BoardName\\BoardPkg.dsc\nBuild\nYes\nNone\nPrimary build file.\n\n\nName\nConsumer\nStandalone Buildable\nFV Produced\nComments\n\n\nMinPlatformPkg\\Include\\CorePreMemoryInclude.fdf\nBoard\nNo\nNone\nCombination of Stage I-IIthat will be processed by compilation building\n\n\nBoardPkg\\BoardName\\BoardPkg.fdf\nBuild\nYes\nYes\nCombination of Stage I-Vthat will be processed by compilation building\n\n\n\nTable 13 Stage I Build Files\n"},"3_stage_1_minimum_debug/39_test_point_results.html":{"url":"3_stage_1_minimum_debug/39_test_point_results.html","title":"3.9 Test Point Results","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The stage is completed when\npermanent memory is installed. Since execution prior to memory initialization\ntypically occurs in a resource-constrained environment, the code in this stage\nis not compressed. To simplify silicon enabling which may be opaque to the\nboard engineer in the form of a binary blob, Stage II enabling does not\nstrictly constrain the extent of silicon initialization. In particular, it is\nrecommended to perform standard security lock functionality such as register\nlocks, privilege level changes, and other actions that are in the system\nrequirements to reduce conditional logic and therefore potential for error in\nenabling those settings. This only pertains to security settings within the\nchipset. This does not include larger industry standard security features such\nas UEFI Secure Boot and TCG measured boot. Those features are enabled in Stage\nV Security Enable.\n\nFigure 5 Stage II Main Control Flow\n"},"4_stage_2_memory_functional/42_firmware_volumes.html":{"url":"4_stage_2_memory_functional/42_firmware_volumes.html","title":"4.2 Firmware Volumes","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The data\nstructure should only contain data. Functions should not be used in silicon\npolicy data.\nWhen a silicon module installs this policy data, it should consider the most\ncommon usage as the default policy data. Therefore, a board module must only\nupdate non-default values instead of all fields.\nThis silicon code may expose the APIs below.\n\nAn API to initialize all policy data to the default value, based upon the\ncurrent silicon.\n\nAn API to tell silicon code that all policy data have been updated, and they\nare ready to consume.\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary\nInterface\nDefinition Location\nProducer\nConsumer in FSP Boot Path\nConsumer in EDK II Path\n\n\n\n\nSiliconPolicyInitLib\nSiliconPolicyInitPreMemory\nSilicon\nSilicon\nFspWrapperPlatformLib\nPlatform\n\n\n\nSiliconPolicyDonePreMemory\nSilicon\nSilicon\nFspWrapperPlatformLib\nPlatform\n\n\n\nSiliconPolicyInitPostMemory\nSilicon\nSilicon\nFspWrapperPlatformLib\nPlatform\n\n\n\nSiliconPolicyDonePostMemory\nSilicon\nSilicon\nFspWrapperPlatformLib\nPlatform\n\n\n\nSiliconPolicyInitLate\nSilicon\nSilicon\nFspWrapperPlatformLib\nPlatform\n\n\n\nSiliconPolicyDoneLate\nSilicon\nSilicon\nFspWrapperPlatformLib\nPlatform\n\n\nSiliconPolicyUpdateLib\nSiliconPolicyUpdatePreMemory\nMinimum Platform /Silicon\nBoard\nFspWrapperPlatformLib\nPlatform\n\n\n\nSiliconPolicyUpdate PostMemory\nMinimum Platform /Silicon\nBoard\nFspWrapperPlatformLib\nPlatform\n\n\n\nSiliconPolicyUpdateLate\nMinimum Platform /Silicon\nBoard\nFspWrapperPlatformLib\nPlatform\n\n\n\nTable 24 Silicon Policy Libraries\n\nNOTE: A general guideline is that pointers should not be used in policies\nthat persist across the CAR to permanent memory boundary as the pointer\naddresses will become invalid. Pre-memory only and post-memory only policies\nare not affected by the memory transition. A pre-memory policy installation\nPEIM should only be used for policies that must be updated in pre-memory for\nearly use by silicon code. The post-memory policy installation PEIM can be\ncompressed and does risk pointers becoming invalidated due to the memory\ntransition.\n\nThe policy configuration HOBs are inherently passed to DXE, so a silicon DXE\nmodule can locate and install a policy protocol for a particular policy if it\nis used in DXE.\n4.6.1.2 Board Module Silicon Policy Data\nUsing the SiliconPolicyUpdateLib, the board package may reference a variety of\nsources to obtain the board-specific policy values, including but limited to\nthe following common sources.\n\nPCD database\n\nUEFI Variable\n\nBinary Blob\n\nBuilt-in C structure\n\nHardware information\n\n\n4.6.1.3 Board Module Silicon Policy Update Completion\nAfter policy configuration is completed, the board may indicate that the policy\nis configured with board-specific actions in the SiliconPolicyDonePreMemory ( )\nAPI in SiliconPolicyInitLib.\n4.6.1.4 Non-IntelÂ® FSP Policy Data Flow\nThe SiliconPolicyPeiPreMemory module in the minimum platform package will\ninvoke the following policy configuration functions in the given order.\n\nBoardPreMemoryInit ()\nSiliconPolicyInitPreMemory ()\nSiliconPolicyUpdatePreMemory ()\nMinimum platform: Minor update of relevant options\nFully featured platform (Stage VI and greater): Full update for all platform\nfeatures\n\n\nSiliconPolicyDonePreMemory ()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 Non-FSP Policy Data Flow\n4.6.1.5 IntelÂ® FSP Policy Data Flow\n\nUpdateFspmUpdData (Upd)\nSiliconPolicyInitPreMemory ()\nSiliconPolicyUpdatePreMemory ()\nMinimum platform: Minor update of relevant options\nFully featured platform (Stage VI and greater): Full update for all platform\nfeatures\nSiliconPolicyDonePreMemory ()\n\n\nFigure 7 FSP Policy Data Flow\n4.6.2 HOB Output\n\nIntelÂ® FSP HOB to PEI HOB transition\nIn an IntelÂ® FSP API mode boot with an EDK II wrapper, the system will have\ntwo HOB lists - one maintained in the FSP PEI environment and the other in the\nFSP wrapper PEI environment. The FSP wrapper environment is responsible for\nconverting data from the FSP HOB to a PEI HOB. These HOBs are\nplatform-specific; examples include the SmbiosHob and GraphicInfoHob.\n\nPEI HOBs for Phase Handoff to DXE\n\n\n4.6.3 MTRR Configuration Settings in Post-Memory\nThe system MTRR settings are typically configured in two locations after\npermanent memory initialization.\n\nAfter permanent memory installation\nAt this point, cache attributes are set for PEI memory usage. This\nspecification does not require any particular MTRR configuration, as it is\nultimately dependent upon platform goals such as functionality and performance\ngiven the device and storage technologies present on the platform. The most\ncommon ranges configured are the default memory setting as UC, the DRAM region\nas WB, and the SPI flash MMIO region as WP. These settings are usually applied\nin a memory installation notification function or a PEIM shadow. The\narchitecture requires that the settings be applied in the board package.\n\nPrior to DXE IPL\nAt this point PEI execution has completed and control is transitioning to the\nDXE phase. The MTRR settings are typically modified to prepare for the DXE\nenvironment. The most common ranges configured are the default memory as WB,\nthe TSEG (SMRAM) region as UC, and MMIO as UC. These settings are usually\napplied in an end of PEI notification function. The architecture requires that\nthe settings be applied in the board package.\n\n\n"},"4_stage_2_memory_functional/47_additional_control_flows.html":{"url":"4_stage_2_memory_functional/47_additional_control_flows.html","title":"4.7 Additional Control Flows","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

A secondary objective for Stage III is to be\nsilicon and board agnostic. All silicon and board specific details should be\nleveraged from Stages I and II. Demonstrating the capability to load the UEFI\nshell does not imply that the UEFI shell is a required component in the end\nproduct firmware. It does ensure that the platforms with a terminal boot stage\ntarget greater than Stage II can load the UEFI shell so the system can be\nanalyzed and configured in the UEFI boot services environment with well-defined\nbehavior in a consistent manner with other Minimum Platform\nspecification-compliant systems.\nThe minimal UI capability that is required is serial console. UEFI variables\nmust be supported with at least emulated variable behavior. UEFI variable\nstorage to a non-volatile media such as SPI NOR flash is acceptable if the\nplatform requirements mandate such support. Additional capabilities are\noptional and must not be assumed.

The minimal boot path only involves functionality necessary to\nload the OS to a state where a user may begin performing more complex\ninteractions. This involves successfully reaching an environment that allows\nthe user to launch applications. The stage does not include support for all\napplications that, for example, may require certain CPU or GPU features\nenabled. Nor does it require any further support, including but not limited to\ndevice and system power management, full hardware performance support enabled,\nsystem reset support, etc.\nAny additional functionality is classified as an advanced feature. Those\nfeatures are collectively enabled in Stage VI.\n6.1.1 Major Execution Activities\n\n\n\nStage IV Modules\n\n\n\n\nMinimum ACPI table initialization\n\n\nAdditional input, output, and storage support based on platform and operating system requirements\n\n\nSMM\n\n\nPerform ACPI enable/disable\n\n\nKernel debug support\n\n\nUEFI variable support\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Main Control Flow\nStage IV introduces additional functionality to meet the minimal requirements\nfor a UEFI-compliant operating system. Much of the support required will be\nperformed during the DXE phase interleaving Stage IV control flows with\npre-existing control flows from Stage III. A minimum set of ACPI tables, namely\nRSDT, FACP, FACS, FADT, MADT, HPET and DSDT, need to be initialized and\npublished. If there are alternative and/or additional operating system\nexpectations such as full DeviceTree support, that should be enabled to allow\nthe operating system to be loaded.\nIt is recommended that only the mandatory boot option devices are connected in\nBDS to minimize complexity and boot time in the minimal execution path to the\noperating system. In the flow diagram below, the left half is identical to the\nfunctionality enabled by Stage III prior to entering the BDS phase. It is\nexpected that the Stage III components are reused to complete Stage IV tasks.\nThe green blocks in Figure 9 Stage IV Control Flow reuse the existing blocks\nfrom Stage III.\n\nFigure 9 Stage IV Main Control Flow\n"},"6_stage_4_boot_to_os/62_firmware_volumes.html":{"url":"6_stage_4_boot_to_os/62_firmware_volumes.html","title":"6.2 Firmware Volumes","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Given the importance of security for all\nconnected systems, the platform architecture considers the following basic\nsecurity features as minimum requirements for any product and thus an important\npart of the effort to produce a minimal platform. This stage is concerned with\nenabling security technologies described in industry specifications.\nLower-level chipset-specific security technologies such as register locks may\nexist and those should be enabled during standard silicon initialization flows\nin earlier stages.\n7.1.1 Major Execution Activities\n\n\n\nStage V Modules\n\n\n\n\nFull UEFI variable services support (i.e. non-volatile, volatile, and authenticated)\n\n\nAuthenticated boot (HW and UEFI)\n\n\nTCG trusted boot (if TPM HW is present)\n\n\nDMA protection\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Main Control Flow\nStage V introduces new modules and requirements to the boot incrementally over\nStage IV. The key requirement is to satisfy industry standard security\nspecifications applicable to the platform. The security technologies enabled in\nthis stage are not strictly bound to the definition in this specification and\nmay consist of a subset or superset of the content described in this section.\nHowever, the only case in which a modern production system should not implement\na form of any of these technologies is if the necessary hardware is not\navailable. In all other cases, the system must at least implement a form of the\nfollowing:\n\nHardware rooted authenticated boot that can establish a Static Root of Trust\nfor Verification (S-RTV) and continue an authenticated chain of verification\nthroughout the boot process.\n\nSystem measurement capability that allows the firmware to serve as a Static\nRoot of Trust for Measurement (S-RTM).\n\nProtection from Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks.\n\n\nThe TCG measured boot chain of trust is should be enabled in this stage. At\nthis point, Authenticated UEFI Variable support must be completely functional.\nThis is a basic requirement for secure authentication and management of the\nUEFI Secure Boot keys.\n"},"7_stage_5_security_enable/72_firmware_volumes.html":{"url":"7_stage_5_security_enable/72_firmware_volumes.html","title":"7.2 Firmware Volumes","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

After power on, the CPU Microcode finds a Boot Guard ACM and \nexecutes the Boot Guard ACM, which is signed by Intel. Then the Boot Guard \nACM takes the Boot Guard manifest and verifies the IBB code.\n\nThe PI specification also provides the verification for the system firmware\ncode on the board. Refer to PI specification, EFI Signed Firmware Volumes and\nEFI Signed Sections.\n\n\nThe whole hardware based secure boot flow on an Intel Boot Guard platform is:\n\nStartup ACM or some equivalent module verifies the initial boot block of the \nsystem firmware.\nIntelÂ® Boot Guard Technology is one possible implementation\n\n\nThe initial boot block verifies the rest of the system firmware.\nPI signed FV is one possible implementation. An implementation may choose \nPKCS7 or RSA2048_SHA256 based signing verification.\nThe other option is just to use the HASH for the rest of the system \nfirmware. In PEI phase, the code who installs the addition FV for the post \nmemory phase need verify the HASH of the system firmware.\n\n\nThe system firmware verifies 3rd party code.\nUEFI secure boot is the implementation.\n\n\n\n7.7.3 TCG Trusted Boot and Memory Overwrite Request (MOR)\nRefer to TCG platform specification and the white paper\nA Tour Beyond BIOS - Implementing TPM Support in EDK II\n7.7.4 DMA (VT-d) Protection\nRefer to IntelÂ® VT-d specification and the white paper\nUsing IOMMU for DMA Protection in UEFI\n"},"7_stage_5_security_enable/78_build_files.html":{"url":"7_stage_5_security_enable/78_build_files.html","title":"7.8 Build Files","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Essential features are defined as\nbeing support required to meet earlier stage boot objectives. An advanced\nfeature must be implemented as highly cohesive and stand-alone software to only\nsupport a specific feature. Modularizing such features, reducing dependencies\non other advanced features, and eliminating dependencies on specific\nimplementations of other advanced features is critical and results in a variety\nof benefits:\n\nThe minimum platform serves as a basic enabling vehicle ready to support\nvarious roles for a given hardware platform. This yields a minimum platform\nsolution that is open to extension but closed for modification.\n\nSystem power-on is simplified because unnecessary code paths and silicon\npaths can be avoided or deferred.\n\nPlatforms can be composed in a more modular and portable manner allowing\ngeneric advanced features to be readily shared among participants.\n\nFeature adoption benefits from modular design that is simple to maintain.\n\n\nOrganizing advanced features in the platform architecture enables better\nrealization of the benefits in UEFI specification compliant firmware with\nhighly cohesive and lowly coupled component interactions.\nThis chapter provides guidance on how to design and integrate advanced features.\nThe source code layout and other maintenance details are outside the scope of this\nspecification.\nThe core advanced feature requirements that must be met:\n\nCohesive, the feature should not contain any functionality unrelated to the feature.\nComplete, the feature must have a complete design that minimizes dependencies. A feature package cannot directly\ndepend on another feature package.\nEasy to Integrate, the feature should expose well-defined software interfaces to use and configure the feature.\nIt should also present a set of simple and well-documented standard EDK II configuration options such as PCDs to\nconfigure the feature.\nIn general, features should be self-contained and started by the dispatcher. The board firmware should\nbe required to perform as few steps as possible to enable the feature.\nAll features are required to have a feature enable PCD (PcdFeatureEnable). Any effort to enable the feature\nbesides this PCD should be carefully considered. Default configuration values should apply to the common case.\n\n\nPortable, the feature is not allowed to depend on other advanced feature or board source code packages. For example,\nif Feature A depends on output Feature B, a board integration module should use a generic interface in Feature A\nto get the output and pass it to a generic interface in Feature B. Structures should not be shared between feature\npackages. Most structures should be defined in a common package such as MdePkg if the structure is industry standard,\nIntelSiliconPkg if the structure is specific to Intel silicon initialization, etc. Feature-specific structures are\nof course allowed to be defined within a feature package and used by libraries and modules in that package.\nSelf Documenting, the feature should follow software best practices to allow others to debug the code and\ncontribute changes. In addition to source code, advanced features must have a Readme.md with sufficient\ninformation for a newcomer to understand the feature.\nSingle Instance, the feature should not have more than one instance of a source solution. If an existing feature\npackage does not solve a specific instance of a problem for the feature, the feature package should be re-worked\nto consider new requirements instead of duplicating feature code.\n\n8.1.1 Major Execution Activities\n\n\n\nStage VI Modules\n\n\n\n\nExecute the Enabled Advanced Features\n\n\n\nThe number of embedded features must be minimized in order to support the\nbroadest compatibility of the minimal platform. Features should be designed to\ndefine an API that can be used to integrate the feature into generic platform\nconfigurations.

In consideration of portability, it\nis recommended to encapsulate each feature within a dedicated package. Such\nencapsulation enables rapid integration of the feature and a focused area for\nfeature-related changes. For example, feature declarations for build elements\nsuch as GUIDs, PCDs, PPIs, and protocols are scoped within the feature package\nDEC file. Including the feature and consequently the package imports the\nfeature tokens within the available namespace and changes affecting the feature\nare localized to the package which in turn exposes the change to all feature\nconsumers.\nThe Advanced Feature template should be used to describe relevant configuration\nfor integrating the feature into a minimum platform compliant system. Any board\nor silicon-specific details should be abstracted such that the information is\nprovided to the feature via \"feature APIs\". Such dependencies are recommended\nto be exposed via binary interfaces such as PPIs and protocols and can be\nconsidered similar in purpose to the architectural PPIs and Protocols defined\nin the PI specification. Such requirements must be included in the \"Required\nFunctions\" section of the advanced feature template. Though not required, to\nincrease portability, advanced features should not depend upon deprecated EDK\nII packages and attempt to reduce exposure to packages other than MdePkg and\nUefiCpuPkg. In turn, this decreases risk of depending upon deprecated packages\nin the future.\n"},"9_stage_7_tuning/":{"url":"9_stage_7_tuning/","title":"9 Stage VII: Tuning","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Any implementation \nmay ignore this stage until this section is completed and this notice is \nremoved.\nIt is anticipated that  future versions of this architecture specification \nwill provide details for embedded performance tuning, common component\ntuning, and more invasive customization. The objective for this section is to\nprovide a spectrum of options that keep as many board designs as consistent as\npossible. Some potential topics follow, but should not be reviewed at this\n\nIn Stage VII, the fully featured is tuned for production.\nFirst, it can be worthwhile to look at the embedded features and performance\noriented options that have been designed into the core or minimum platform. For\nexample, if you do not support network boot, the PciBus driver provides a PCD\nto disable dispatching the network option ROM. By default, network option ROM\ndispatch is enabled. This is a known tunable setting.\nSecond, it can be worthwhile to strip unused components from the defined FV.\nFor simplicity and consistency of progressing through Stage VI, it is better to\nuse the provided code consistent with the architecture. Once a stable and fully\nfunctional system is completed, it is intended that platform architecture\ncompatible systems can still remove unneeded components in order to finely tune\nthe product. The core provides a tool named FMMT that can be used to process\nthe build output and remove unnecessary components. Alternatively, a board can\ncopy and modify the provided Build DSC and FDF files in the MinPlatformPkg and\nSiliconPkg. The former increases build time. The latter increases integration\neffort for new core, MinPlatformPkg, and SiliconPkg releases.\nThird, it is often necessary to enable and use tools to perform detailed\nanalysis of performance and size to identify hotspots that need to be improved.\n"},"appendix_a_full_maps/":{"url":"appendix_a_full_maps/","title":"Appendix A Full Maps","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Similarly ACPI\nimplementation should have a minimal framework implemented for ACPI compliant\nOS.\nThe DSDT in this case should have a root and system bus defined.

For scalability purposes, the ACPI devices are categorized in a manner\nthat they can be easily plugged in and out of UEFI FW.\nC.3.1 Silicon Specific Devices\nThese devices are silicon specific and are assumed to not change with different\nSKUs and stepping of the silicon. These devices will become part of DSDT as it\nis a mandatory table containing the fixed devices for the systems.\nThe number of silicon devices present in the DSDT will be decided by the scope\nof minimum and full build.\nC.3.2 SKU Specific Devices\nThese devices are SKU specific and are assumed to change based on various SKUs.\nThey are considered to be dynamic as they can be enabled/disabled/modified\nbased on setup knobs or softstraps etc.\nBecause of their dynamic nature, these devices are added in the Platform SSDT.\nEvery SKU will have a unique Platform SSDT installed. It will only contain\ndevices present on that platform.\nC.3.3 Board Specific Devices\nThese devices are board specific and are assumed to change based on the various\nboard SKUs. These devices will also become part of SSDTs. These devices can\nhave an SSDT of their own or get added to the platform SSDT depending on their\navailability on multiple SKUs. A fairly common board device will be added to\nthe platform SSDT and the other devices can have a SSDT of their own.\nC.3.4 Feature Specific Devices/Methods\nThese devices or methods are optional as they are exposed to handle certain\nadvanced features. They will be added to DSDT or SSDT depending on the device\nthey are being added for. For example a special DSM (device specific method) is\nto be added for an Audio codec, then it will fall under the Platform/Board SSDT.\n"},"appendix_c_acpi/c4_flow_diagrams.html":{"url":"appendix_c_acpi/c4_flow_diagrams.html","title":"C.4 Flow Diagrams","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
